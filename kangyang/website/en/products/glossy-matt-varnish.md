## What is Glossy/Matt Varnish?

Glossy and matt varnish refers to a specialized coating applied either fully or partially to printed labels or stickers. This finish not only elevates the look and feel of your product but also adds a layer of protection against minor wear and environmental factors.

- **Glossy Varnish**: Delivers a shiny, reflective surface that enhances color vibrancy and image clarity.
- **Matt Varnish**: Offers a smooth, non-glossy finish that exudes sophistication and reduces glare.

Both finishes are cost-effective, making them ideal for large-volume orders or brands seeking a premium appearance without significant additional cost.
