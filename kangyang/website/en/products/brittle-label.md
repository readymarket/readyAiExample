# Brittle Label (Eggshell Sticker) – Tamper-Evident Protection for Warranty & Security

## What is a Brittle Label?

Brittle labels, also known as eggshell stickers, are a specialized security label solution designed to fragment and crack upon removal. When applied to a surface, these tamper-evident labels cannot be removed in one piece—any attempt to peel them off results in the label breaking into small, irreparable pieces. This unique property makes brittle labels ideal for warranty protection, anti-counterfeit measures, and any application where proof of tampering is required.
