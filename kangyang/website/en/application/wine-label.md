- **Luxury Finishes:** Choose from gold/silver foil stamping, hot stamping in various colors, embossing, debossing, or high-gloss/matte varnishes for a premium tactile feel.
- **Partial Adhesive Technology:** Specify adhesive zones for creative design effects and easy removal, or for “floating” label aesthetics.
- **Variable Data Printing:** Incorporate unique serial numbers, QR codes, or promotional codes for traceability, anti-counterfeiting, or interactive marketing.
