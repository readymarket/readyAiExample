To create a high-value, SEO-optimized application page for the pharmaceutical industry (bottle/can/box, booklet/two-layer/three-sided label), I need to:

1. Identify buyer expectations:
   - Regulatory compliance and information-rich labeling.
   - Space-saving labels for small containers.
   - Clarity, durability, and anti-counterfeit features.
   - Customization for various packaging forms (bottle, can, box).
   - Efficient order fulfillment and quality assurance.

2. Pinpoint relevant Kang Yang products:
   - Booklet Label (up to 9 pages, for detailed product info).
   - 2 Ply Label/Double Layer Sticker (increased info capacity, collectible, replaces leaflets).
   - Double Layer Three-Sided Promotional Coupon Label (multi-sided, scratch-off, QR code for traceability).
   - Hidden Label Inside 2 Ply Label (additional security/marketing layer).
   - Index Booklet Label/Sticker (compact, reusable, for supplementary info).

3. Highlight pharmaceutical-specific benefits:
   - Consolidates regulatory, usage, and marketing info on small packages.
   - Reduces packaging complexity and potential leaflet loss.
   - Enhances consumer engagement (QR codes, serial numbers, scratch-off).
   - Supports automation and high-volume production (roll formats, standard procedures).
   - High-quality, certified production (ISO9001, FSC).

4. Integrate SEO keywords:
   - Pharmaceutical label solutions, booklet labels, two-layer stickers for pharma, multi-page pharmaceutical labels, regulatory compliant labels, pharma bottle/can/box labeling, anti-counterfeit pharmaceutical stickers, booklet label manufacturer.

5. Structure:
   - Engaging intro (addressing pharma industry challenges & Kang Yang's solutions).
   - Product application breakdown (for bottle/can/box, with specific label types).
   - Features/advantages for pharmaceutical buyers.
   - Use cases/examples.
   - FAQ section for common buyer queries.
   - No company intro/contact as per instruction.
