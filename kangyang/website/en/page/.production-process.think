For the "Production Process" page, the goal is to create an SEO-optimized, professional, and comprehensive explanation suitable for B2B buyers interested in custom label and sticker printing. The content should:
- Clearly outline each stage of Kang Yang's advanced production process, emphasizing automation, ISO9001 quality control, and FSC certification to attract international clients.
- Use relevant keywords like "custom sticker production process", "label manufacturing", "quality control", "B2B label printing", "OEM sticker production", etc.
- Address typical buyer questions: What are the production steps? How does Kang Yang ensure quality and efficiency? What customization is possible? What technologies and materials are used?
- Highlight the benefits for buyers: efficiency, reliability, flexibility for custom orders, and environmental responsibility.
- Reference the provided structure and details from the official website, integrating product types and specialized printing techniques as appropriate.
- Avoid company contact details or general company introduction, focusing solely on the process and its advantages.
