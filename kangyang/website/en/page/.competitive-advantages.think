For the page /page/competitive-advantages.md, I need to create a comprehensive overview of Kang Yang Printing's core competitive advantages and differentiators in the B2B sticker printing industry. The target audience is international B2B buyers, procurement managers, and business owners, especially in Europe, Japan, Australia, and Southeast Asia. 

Key priorities for this content:
- Emphasize proprietary technologies and patents (such as the 2 Ply Scratch Sticker, Booklet Sticker, etc.)
- Highlight ISO9001 and FSC certification to appeal to quality-conscious and environmentally focused buyers, particularly in Europe.
- Showcase production efficiency (automation, JIT, BTO, ETO) and robust quality control.
- Stress customized service, technical expertise, and the ability to support complex OEM requirements.
- Position Kang Yang against competitors by highlighting unique strengths (patents, automation, long-term experience, environmental credentials).
- Integrate SEO keywords naturally (e.g., patented stickers, B2B sticker printing, OEM sticker manufacturer, FSC certified sticker supplier, custom label solutions).

The content should be well-structured, easy to scan, and concise with bullet points and short paragraphs, suitable for B2B decision-makers seeking reliable, innovative, and globally competitive printing partners. No need to include contact info or company introduction, as this is a competitive advantage page.
