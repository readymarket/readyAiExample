To optimize the "Prepress and File Guidelines" page for B2B buyers seeking professional printing services, I will:
- Focus on the most common prepress questions, file preparation issues, and terminology that are critical for high-quality label and sticker printing.
- Structure the page using SEO-friendly headings (H1-H3) and include essential keywords such as "prepress guidelines," "file preparation for printing," "bleed," "CMYK vs RGB," "converting text to outlines," and "color management in printing."
- Provide clear answers to FAQ-style queries, reflecting Kang Yang’s expertise and reassuring buyers of the company’s technical support.
- Emphasize the importance of proper file setup to prevent production delays and ensure optimal results.
- Avoid including contact details or company overview, as this is a knowledge base page.
- Reference the Kang Yang Printing official sources for technical accuracy.
- Organize content for easy scanning by B2B buyers and decision-makers, helping them understand the importance of prepress preparation and what is expected when submitting files for custom label printing.
