# Brittle Label – Tamper Evident Eggshell Stickers & Security Solutions

## What is a Brittle Label?

A **brittle label**—also known as an **eggshell sticker**, **tamper-evident label**, or **warranty seal**—is a specialized security sticker designed to provide unmistakable evidence of tampering or unauthorized removal. Once applied, brittle labels are extremely fragile; any attempt to peel off the label will cause it to break and fragment, preventing reuse or transfer.

## How Brittle Labels Work

Brittle labels are manufactured using a unique material composition that ensures the sticker will crack or shatter into small pieces when removal is attempted. This makes them ideal for applications where product integrity, warranty protection, and brand security are paramount. The eggshell-like behavior of these labels is why they are frequently called "eggshell stickers."
