# Laser Labels: Rainbow Color & Anti-Counterfeit Solutions

## What is a Laser Label?

Laser labels, also known as holographic or rainbow labels, feature a vibrant, metallic surface that shifts color depending on the viewing angle. These labels are highly valued for their visual impact, durability, and advanced anti-counterfeiting capabilities, making them ideal for brands seeking both eye-catching packaging and enhanced product security.

## Key Features
