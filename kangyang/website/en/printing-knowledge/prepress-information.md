# Prepress and File Guidelines

Proper file preparation is critical to achieving the best results in custom label and sticker printing. Below are Kang Yangâ€™s professional prepress guidelines to help you deliver print-ready files, avoid production delays, and ensure your finished products meet the highest quality standards.

## What Is Bleed and Why Is It Important?

**Bleed** is a necessary extension of your artwork beyond the final trim size of your label or sticker. Because slight variations can occur during the cutting process, adding a 3mm bleed around all sides ensures that your design or background color extends fully to the edge, preventing unwanted white borders or cutoff edges.

**Best Practice:**  
Always include at least 3mm of bleed on each side of your file. Design important elements (like logos and text) at least 3mm inside the trim line to avoid accidental cropping.

## Converting Text to Outlines

Fonts may render differently on various computers due to font licensing and compatibility. To guarantee consistent text appearance and avoid missing font issues during printing, **convert all text to outlines (curves)** before submitting your files. Once converted, text becomes a vector shape, ensuring your design appears as intended.

## Color Mode: CMYK vs RGB

- **RGB** (Red, Green, Blue) is used for digital screens.
- **CMYK** (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Black) is the standard for printing.

Always supply your files in **CMYK color mode** to minimize color discrepancies. Files provided in RGB may result in unexpected color shifts after conversion to CMYK for print production.

## Color Consistency and Limitations

- The same color may look different on screens, inkjet proofs, and final printed labels due to material and device variances. Always use **printed samples as your color reference**.
- After lamination or applying varnish, there may be subtle changes in color. Even with sample prints, a 100% color match is not always possible.
- Slight color variation (within about 3%) between different print runs is considered normal due to changes in density, temperature, and other production variables.

## FAQ: Prepress Preparation

**Q1: What file formats are accepted?**  
A: We recommend vector file formats such as AI, PDF, or EPS for best results. High-resolution (300dpi or higher) TIFF or JPEG files are also accepted for raster images.

**Q2: How should I set up my die-cut or custom shape labels?**  
A: Please include a separate vector path for the cutting line, clearly labeled, and ensure it does not overlap with critical design elements.

**Q3: Should I embed or link images in my files?**  
A: Embed all images and graphics to prevent missing file errors.

**Q4: How do I ensure white ink or spot colors print correctly?**  
A: Clearly specify spot colors as Pantone or provide a separate layer for white ink instructions.
