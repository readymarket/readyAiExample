# 3C/Electronics Industry Label Solutions

Elevate your electronic products with specialized label solutions engineered for the unique demands of the 3C/Electronics industry. Kang Yang Printing offers a comprehensive portfolio of high-performance labels that ensure product authenticity, enhance brand security, and streamline traceability — all tailored for electronics manufacturers and distributors.

## Barcode & Serial Number Labels

**Purpose:**  
Enable precise product tracking, inventory management, and supply chain transparency. Each label can be customized with unique barcodes, serial numbers, or QR codes for seamless integration into your logistics and warranty systems.

**Key Features:**
- High-resolution printing for barcode/serial accuracy
- Variable data (unique codes for each unit)
- Options for durable, moisture-resistant, and heat-resistant materials
- Custom sizes, shapes, and adhesive strengths

## Laser Security Labels

**Purpose:**  
Add a premium, tamper-evident touch to your electronics with laser labels. Their vibrant, color-shifting effect not only enhances product appearance but also delivers a strong deterrent against counterfeiting.

**Key Features:**
- Silver surface with dynamic, multi-color shine at different angles
- FSC-certified, eco-friendly materials available
- Waterproof, moisture-proof, and tear-resistant
- Excellent adhesion to plastic, metal, and glass surfaces
- Customizable with logos, microtext, or hidden security features

## VOID Anti-Counterfeit Labels

**Purpose:**  
Protect your brand and customers from counterfeit threats. VOID labels instantly reveal a “VOID” mark or hidden message if tampered with, making them ideal for warranty seals and high-value electronics packaging.

**Key Features:**
- Anti-tampering, anti-counterfeit technology
- Customizable background or partial text reveal
- Permanent adhesive for secure application
- High effectiveness for warranty, authentication, and safety seals

## Brittle (Eggshell) Fragile Labels

**Purpose:**  
Ensure warranty coverage and detect unauthorized access. Brittle or “eggshell” stickers shatter into pieces when removed, providing clear evidence of tampering.

**Key Features:**
- Shatters or fragments upon removal
- Ideal for warranty seals, security closures, and asset management
- Custom print options (serials, logos, holograms)
- Adheres to various surfaces, including plastics and metals

## Two-Layer (2 Ply) & Double-Sided Labels

**Purpose:**  
Maximize information delivery and interactivity. Two-layer and double-sided labels offer additional printable space — perfect for product instructions, warranty terms, or marketing campaigns (e.g., scratch-off promotions).

**Key Features:**
- Double-layer inner pages for expanded content
- Re-stickable and collectible designs
- Optional scratch-off, QR code, or serial number integration
- Replace traditional instruction manuals and reduce risk of loss
- Patent-protected processes for marketing effectiveness
