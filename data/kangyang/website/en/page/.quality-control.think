1. The topic is about "Quality management and inspection process (ISO procedures)" for Kang Yang Printing, a B2B OEM sticker printing company with ISO9001 and FSCÂ®-COC certifications.
2. The goal is to create an SEO-optimized page that details the company's quality control processes, highlighting ISO procedures, quality assurance, inspection steps, and how these benefit B2B clients.
3. The reference page provides a broad overview of their production process and product types, but not in-depth content about quality management, so I need to synthesize information from the company profile and typical ISO9001 procedures.
4. Key buyer expectations: strict quality control, traceable processes, certifications, consistent product quality, and reliable delivery timetables.
5. Important keywords: quality management, ISO9001, quality control, inspection process, FSC certification, B2B sticker printing, production process, quality assurance.
6. The content should be structured for clarity: intro, overview of certifications, step-by-step quality management process, inspection methods, benefits for B2B buyers, and an FAQ.
7. Exclude company contact details or general company introduction as per workflow instructions.
