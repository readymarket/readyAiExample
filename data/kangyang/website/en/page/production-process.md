As a leader in OEM label and sticker manufacturing, Kang Yang Printing combines state-of-the-art automation, industry expertise, and rigorous quality assurance to meet the diverse needs of clients across industries. Our robust workflow ensures efficiency, flexibility, and outstanding results for every project—whether you require 2 ply stickers, booklet labels, scratch-off stickers, or advanced specialty print finishes.

### 1. Prepress Consultation & File Preparation

- **Consultation & Customization:** Our dedicated team collaborates with you to understand your unique requirements, including dimensions, materials, security features (e.g., QR codes, serial numbers), and special finishes.
- **Artwork Review:** We provide thorough guidance on prepress specifications, such as bleed settings (recommended 3mm), color mode (CMYK for print accuracy), and font outline conversion to ensure flawless production.
- **Proofing:** Clients receive digital or physical proofs for approval, minimizing errors and ensuring brand consistency.

### 2. Material Selection

- **Wide Material Range:** Choose from paper, synthetic, PET, PVC, foils, and eco-friendly substrates (FSC certified), optimized for your product and application.
- **Specialty Options:** Including textured papers, security labels (VOID, brittle), UV-resistant films, and polycarbonate labels for high-durability requirements.

### 3. Printing & Specialty Processes

- **Color Printing:** High-resolution, multi-color printing for vibrant, precise results.
- **Special Printing Effects:** Enhance your labels with gold/silver foil stamping, embossing/debossing, glossy/matte varnish, frosted finish, and scratch-off inks.
- **Variable Data Printing:** Add serial numbers, random codes, and unique QR codes generated from client data, supporting promotions, traceability, and anti-counterfeiting.

### 4. Laminating & Finishing

- **Protective Laminating:** Optional glossy or matte lamination to enhance durability and appearance.
- **Die-Cutting & Shaping:** Custom die-cutting to any shape or configuration, including multi-layer (2 ply) and booklet structures for expanded functionality.
- **Assembly:** For complex products like booklet labels (up to 9 pages), multi-layer stickers, and pop-up designs.

### 5. Quality Assurance

- **ISO9001 Quality Control:** Every production stage is monitored by a dedicated QC team, ensuring consistency, accuracy, and adherence to international standards.
- **Color Consistency:** We maintain tight color tolerances, but note that slight (<3%) color variance may occur due to material or process factors—common in high-end printing.

### 6. Packaging & Logistics

- **Flexible Packaging:** Labels can be supplied in rolls or sheets, compatible with automatic labeling machines to streamline your production line.
