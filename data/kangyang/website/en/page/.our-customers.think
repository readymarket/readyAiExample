For the page /page/our-customers.md, the goal is to create an SEO-optimized introduction to Kang Yang Printing's major customers and showcase relevant case studies. The content needs to:

1. Highlight the variety of industries Kang Yang serves, such as food, beverage, beauty/cosmetics, chemical, pharmaceutical, electronics, household goods, wine, stationery, and pet gifts.
2. Mention long-term cooperation with well-known domestic and international brands, underlining trust, product quality, and Kang Yang’s patented label solutions.
3. Illustrate how Kang Yang’s customized B2B sticker printing solutions solve specific customer pain points (e.g., regulatory compliance for pharma, shelf appeal for beauty, anti-counterfeit for electronics).
4. Incorporate keywords like: custom label printing, OEM sticker manufacturer, patented multi-layer label, B2B sticker supplier, industry case studies, and client success stories.
5. Present at least 3 industry-specific mini case studies or usage scenarios, reflecting the company’s expertise and product application.
6. Avoid contact details or company intro, as per instructions.
7. Keep the tone professional, informative, and targeted at procurement and business decision-makers.

The reference material mainly provides industry application summaries, product advantages, and general statements about customer use cases. Therefore, synthesized, anonymized case studies should be created for SEO value and buyer trust.
