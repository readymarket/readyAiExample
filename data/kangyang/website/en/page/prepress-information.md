## Why Prepress Preparation Matters

Prepress preparation is the foundation of successful label and sticker production. Clear, accurate files minimize errors, reduce turnaround times, and ensure color consistency and sharpness—whether for 2 ply label stickers, booklet stickers, or any other specialty material. Following these guidelines helps you avoid costly reprints and ensures your finished products look exactly as planned.

## Essential File Preparation Guidelines

### 1. Bleed Setup

**What is Bleed?**  
Bleed refers to the extra area around your artwork that extends beyond the final cut line. This prevents unwanted white borders due to slight shifts during trimming.

- **Standard bleed size:** Please extend your design elements 3mm beyond each edge of your final label or sticker size.
- **Why it matters:** Without bleed, minor cutting variations can leave visible white edges on your printed stickers or labels.

### 2. Converting Text to Outlines

**Why convert text to outlines?**  
Different computers may not have the same fonts installed, leading to font substitution or errors.

- **How to do it:** Convert all text in your artwork to outlines (also called curves). This turns your text into vector shapes, ensuring your chosen font and design display correctly during printing.
- **Best practice:** Always double-check your file after converting text to outlines for any unintended changes.

### 3. Image Color Mode: CMYK vs RGB

**Printing requires CMYK color mode.**

- **CMYK** is the standard color mode for all print production and delivers accurate color results.
- **RGB** is used for digital screens and will look different when printed.
- **Action required:** Always convert your artwork files to CMYK mode before submission to minimize color discrepancies in the final print.

### 4. Color Consistency and Reference

**Why do colors look different on screens and print?**  
Colors on computer monitors, inkjet printouts, and press-printed labels will all display differently due to varying materials and technologies.

- **Recommendation:** Use printed samples or Pantone swatches as your reference for color expectations. Web or digital previews are for reference only.

### 5. Effects of Lamination

**Will lamination affect color?**  
Yes—after lamination (glossy or matte), slight color changes may occur. This is a normal part of the finishing process and cannot be fully predicted even with sample prints.

### 6. Color Variation Across Print Runs

**Can the same file yield different colors in separate print runs?**  
Slight color variations (within about 3%) are normal between different batches due to variables like ink density and temperature. This is within industry tolerance and considered acceptable.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q1: What is the recommended file format for submitting artwork?**  
A: Please provide vector files in formats such as AI, PDF, or EPS. Ensure all images are embedded and text is converted to outlines.

**Q2: How should I set up my artwork for a special finish (foil stamping, embossing, etc.)?**  
A: Please supply separate vector layers for each special finish, clearly labeled within your file. This helps our prepress team prepare accurate plates and ensures flawless execution.

**Q3: What resolution is required for images or photos?**  
A: All raster images should be at least 300 dpi at actual print size for sharp, professional results.

**Q4: Can you match colors exactly to other printed materials?**  
A: While we strive for the closest possible match, variations are possible due to differences in substrates and processes. Please provide physical samples or Pantone references for critical color matching.
