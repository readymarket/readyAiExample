## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What is the most suitable label material for food, cosmetic, or industrial applications?**  
A: The best material depends on the application environment, regulatory requirements, and branding goals. For example, glossy synthetic and polyester are common for cosmetics and food packaging due to their water resistance and print quality.

**Q: How does special printing (like foil stamping or scratch-off) impact lead time and cost?**  
A: Special effects require additional production steps and may add to lead time and cost, but deliver significant branding and functional benefits. Kang Yang's automated lines ensure efficiency even for complex jobs.

**Q: What should I provide for prepress?**  
A: Always supply artwork with 3mm bleed, text converted to outlines, and files in CMYK color mode to achieve optimal print results.

**Q: Will the print color look exactly the same as my screen or previous print runs?**  
A: There may be minor color variations due to differences in material, ink, and environmental factors. A color difference within 3% is considered normal in the industry.

**Q: Can I integrate QR codes or unique serial numbers into my labels?**  
A: Yes, Kang Yang can automatically generate and print random QR codes or serials for product tracking, promotions, and security.
