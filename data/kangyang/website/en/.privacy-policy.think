For the privacy policy page, the audience is primarily B2B customers and website visitors who are concerned about how their data is collected, used, and protected. The page should clearly describe the scope of the policy, the types of data collected, how it is used, data protection measures, sharing policy, and users’ rights. High-value SEO keywords should include “privacy policy,” “personal data protection,” “data security,” “cookie policy,” and “B2B privacy.” The language needs to be professional, trustworthy, and comprehensive to meet international standards. The content needs to reflect compliance with global B2B expectations. No contact details or company introduction should be included on this policy page.
