## What is a Double Layer Sticker?

A **Double Layer Sticker** (also called a 2 Ply Label) consists of two adhesive layers. The top layer can be peeled to reveal an inner label, providing extra space for product information, variable data, or interactive marketing elements such as QR codes and scratch-off games. This design maximizes label utility without increasing packaging size.
