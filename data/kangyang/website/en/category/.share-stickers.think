This task is to create an SEO-optimized category overview page for "Share Stickers" for Kang Yang, targeting B2B buyers, especially in the international OEM market. The content must highlight product types (Peel Open Surprise Sticker, Waterproof and Reusable Sticker Set), their unique features, B2B benefits, and relevant applications. The content should integrate targeted keywords such as "custom share stickers," "marketing stickers," "reusable stickers," "surprise stickers for promotions," and "B2B sticker supplier." The tone should be professional and focused on the needs of businesses seeking unique, high-quality, and customizable sticker solutions for marketing, branding, or promotional use.

Buyers in this segment are looking for:
- Customization options
- Unique promotional tools
- Product safety (washable, residue-free)
- Versatile applications (retail, events, gifts, FMCG)
- Quality assurance and certifications (ISO, FSC)
- Efficient order fulfillment and international shipping

I'll provide a clear overview of the category, describe key products and their business benefits, suggest applications, and include a concise FAQ that addresses likely buyer concerns (customization, washability, order process, etc.).

I will not include company contact info or a general company introduction, as per instructions.

References will be cited for traceability.
