- Identify key types of special material stickers Kang Yang offers, highlighting their features and use cases.
- Use high-value keywords like "special material labels," "security sticker," "metallic sticker," "eco-friendly label," etc.
- Address B2B buyer expectations: durability, anti-counterfeiting, premium look, customization, industry applications, and compliance (FSC, ISO).

- Briefly introduce each sub-type with application highlights.
- Include an FAQ with procurement, customization, and technical questions.
