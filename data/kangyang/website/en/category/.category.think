For this task, I need to create an SEO-optimized product category overview page for Kang Yang Printing Co., Ltd., focusing on their range of specialty label and sticker products for B2B customers. The target audience includes international buyers, especially in the fields of food, beverage, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, cosmetics, electronics, and more. The content should:

- Give an at-a-glance overview of main product categories and their unique selling points.
- Integrate high-value keywords naturally for search engine visibility (e.g., "custom label printing," "double layer sticker," "booklet label," "scratch-off stickers," "foil printing labels," etc.).
- Communicate the key benefits of Kang Yang’s patented technology, quality certifications (ISO9001, FSC), and high-efficiency OEM production model.
- Address typical buyer needs: product range, customization, technical capabilities, application versatility, and quality assurance.
- Encourage further exploration of product pages but avoid including company contacts or broad company introduction, per instructions.

I will structure the page with:
- A brief introduction to the category and Kang Yang’s value proposition in special printing.
- A breakdown of each major product category with a short description and bullet points of key features/applications.
- Keywords embedded for SEO.
- A summary or call-to-action to explore individual product categories.

References are drawn from the official English and Chinese catalogs and the official website's product/category structure.
